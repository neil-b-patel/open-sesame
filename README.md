- Ensure you have installed and configured MySQL (v8 or later)
- Ensure your MySQL Database's HOST/USER/PASSWD/DB_NAME matches the entries in .env
- Ensure .env is in the same directory as manager.py
- If "add",  "get", "update", or "delete" are not working, ensure you have successfully logged in with "login"
- If this the first time you are using this app, ensure you have successfully an account with "setup"
